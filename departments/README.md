# Department Admin Module - Django REST Framework Implementation

## Overview

The Department Admin Module provides comprehensive functionality for department administrators to manage scholarship applications, generate reports, and maintain department-specific data. This module implements a complete workflow for reviewing institute-approved applications, making department-level decisions, and forwarding approved applications to the finance module.

## Features

- **Verified Applications List**: View all institute-approved applications for the department
- **Application Review**: Approve or reject applications with detailed comments
- **Application Workflow Tracking**: Monitor application progress through different stages
- **Bulk Operations**: Perform actions on multiple applications simultaneously

### 2. Finance Integration
- **Forward to Finance**: Send department-approved applications to finance module
- **Batch Processing**: Forward multiple applications with priority settings
- **Tracking**: Monitor forwarded applications status

### 3. Dashboard & Analytics
- **Real-time Metrics**: Application counts, approval rates, financial summaries
- **Visual Charts**: Monthly trends, status distributions, processing efficiency
- **Performance Indicators**: Processing times, pending items, alerts

### 4. Comprehensive Reporting
- **Summary Reports**: Application statistics and departmental performance
- **Detailed Reports**: Complete application data with filtering options
- **Financial Reports**: Amount analysis and budget tracking
- **Performance Reports**: Processing efficiency and workflow analytics
- **Course-wise Reports**: Application distribution by courses
- **Forwarded Tracking**: Status of applications sent to finance

### 5. Department Management
- **Profile Management**: Department information and settings
- **Admin User Management**: Role-based access control
- **Resource Management**: Courses, students, and faculty data

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Django 4.2+
- Django REST Framework
- Redis (for caching)
- PostgreSQL/MySQL (recommended)

### Required Packages
```bash
pip install django
pip install djangorestframework
pip install django-redis
pip install openpyxl  # For Excel export
pip install celery    # For background tasks
```

### Configuration

1. **Add to INSTALLED_APPS**:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'rest_framework',
    'departments',
    # ... other apps
]
```

2. **Configure Redis Caching**:
```python
CACHES = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'django_redis.cache.RedisCache',
        'LOCATION': 'redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1',
    }
}
```

3. **Include URLs**:
```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('api/departments/', include('departments.urls')),
]
```

## Usage Examples

### Frontend Integration

**Get Verified Applications**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/departments/applications/verified/', {
    headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
});
const applications = await response.json();
```

**Review Application**
```javascript
const reviewData = {
    action: 'dept_approve',
    dept_remarks: 'Application meets all department criteria',
    final_approved_amount: 50000
};

const response = await fetch(`/api/departments/applications/${appId}/review/`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(reviewData)
});
```

**Get Dashboard Data**
```javascript
const dashboard = await fetch('/api/departments/dashboard/', {
    headers: {'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`}
}).then(r => r.json());

// Use dashboard.key_metrics, dashboard.charts, etc.
```

### Report Generation

**Generate Summary Report**
```javascript
const report = await fetch('/api/departments/reports/summary/?date_range=2024-01-01,2024-12-31', {
    headers: {'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`}
}).then(r => r.json());
```

**Export to Excel**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/departments/reports/detailed/?format=excel', {
    headers: {'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`}
});
const blob = await response.blob();
// Handle file download
```

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests for all API endpoints
- Permission testing
- Data validation testing
- Integration tests with external modules

### Sample Test Commands
```bash
python manage.py test departments.tests.test_api_views
python manage.py test departments.tests.test_permissions
python manage.py test departments.tests.test_serializers
```

## Monitoring & Logging

### Audit Trail
- All application decisions logged
- User action tracking
- System event monitoring
- Performance metrics collection

### Logging Configuration
```python
LOGGING = {
    'loggers': {
        'departments': {
            'handlers': ['file', 'console'],
            'level': 'INFO',
        }
    }
}
```

## Deployment Considerations

### Production Setup
- Use proper database (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Configure Redis for caching
- Set up proper logging
- Enable security middleware
- Configure static/media file serving

### Environment Variables
```bash
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost/db
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/1
DEBUG=False
```
